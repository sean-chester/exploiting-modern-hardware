  \color{black}{By the end of the course, you should be able to:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Understand the fundamental components of several modern hardware architectures, including Intel $\geq$ Haswell microarchitectures, multi-socket parallelism, and general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs)
    \item Redesign algorithms and implementations to better utilise such architectures
    \item Evaluate and diagnose program bottlenecks
    \item Relate these concepts to state-of-the-art research
  \end{itemize}
