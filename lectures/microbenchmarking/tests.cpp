/**
 * This file generates a unit test suite using the Catch2 header-only library.
 * The library contains a main method to make this a stand alone application,
 * which consists of all our tests.
 * 
 * A unit test is a test that isolates and verifies an isolated unit of an application.
 * In this lecture, the solutions are all very small, so we're testing them directly.
 * We will typically take a test-first approach in class to clarify the goals/specs
 * before we start. If you are not thoroughly comfortable with unit testing, I recommend
 * the following resource: https://www.toptal.com/qa/how-to-write-testable-code-and-why-it-matters
 * Catch2 also provides a lot of more advanced tips: https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/master/docs
 *
 * I have selected Catch2 because of its simplicity. (It is the unit test framework that I use in
 * my own research as well.) Alternatives such as GTest by Google are more ubiquitous. The trade-off
 * for Catch's simplicity is a slow build time; however, this only affects your test suite, not
 * your main application.
 *
 * As the problems that we tackle become more difficult, a solid testing methodology becomes even
 * more important. But now's as good a time as any to become comfortable with both unit testing
 * and the concept of tests-as-documentation.

// You are welcome to define these however makes sense to your application
// Ideally, you should have one test case to cover each branch of control flow that your code may take
// I.e., these tests are *incomplete*
// This is an example of tests-as-documentation. We simultaneously describe how the system is
// supposed to behave *and* test that it behaves that way. If the documentation becomes obsolete,
// so does the test, and then it fails. When writing documentation, it is worth considering
// whether those comments would make for a good test, too/instead.
