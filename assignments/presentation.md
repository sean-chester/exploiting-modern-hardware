# CSC 586C Term Project: Presentation

*A final presentation for grad students to reflect on the entire project*


## Objective

Having now completed your project investigating several shared-memory computational models, you should now communicate to a broad audience what you have done.


## Submission

This is an *individual* assignment for *grad students only*. Each of you should submit separate presentation materials that you develop on your own and that highlight your individual contribution to the group project. This year, you won't actually deliver the presentation, only submit the slides and transcript for marking. (You are welcome to record a presentation if you want, but this will not lead to higher grade, and you may encounter difficulties uploading a large file size in conneX.)

You should submit exactly five slides (plus an optional cover slide) that cover the following material:

 * Introduction to and/or motivation for the problem you studied in your project
 * The optimisations you made in the super-scalar model
 * The parallelisation you achieved in the SIMD and/or multi-core models
 * The parallelisation you achieved in the SIMT/GPGPU model
 * A concluding slide with future outlook

You should also submit a transcript or audio recording that corresponds to 5-8 minutes of narration. That text should be targeted to fulfilling the rubric criteria outlined below.


## Evaluation

You will be evaluated according to 6 criteria on a 3-point scale {0, 1, 2} as noted below; these grades correspond to {absent, insufficient, sufficient}. Please focus the level of the presentation to a broad CS audience.

|Criterion|Weight|Example Factors|
|---------|------|-------|
|Quality of Presentation|10 %|Aesthetics of slides; Timing; Engagement|
|Accessible|20%|Mostly understandable by general CS audience|
|Problem Motivated|10%|Interestingness; impact; novelty of approach|
|Individual Contribution Apparent|30%|Substantial contribution communicated; Understands whole project|
|All Models Understood|20%|Technical accuracy; differences between approaches clear|
|Thought-provoking conclusion|10%|Interesting in: future work or study limitations or how concepts will be applied in future|
