# CSC 485C/586C Term Project

*A semester-long recurring application of course concepts to a concrete data management problem of your choice*


## Objective

You emerge from this class proficient in solving problems on modern computer architectures. I want you to be able to demonstrate that with more than just a letter grade. While others can claim mastery of optimisation and parallel computing, you will be able to _showcase_ it.

At the same time, sustained _application_ of this course content establishes a much deeper level of understanding than stopping at the conceptual level (e.g., exams). Would you like to have your hair cut by somebody who has never held a pair of scissors?

The ultimate goal for optimisation and parallelisation is to make applications faster or more scalable. Thus, your project will achieve exactly that: **your goal is to use the course concepts to solve a problem orders of magnitude faster, or in a manner that is orders of magnitude more scalable, than not using the course concepts. Just as importantly, you will demonstrate _why_ your solution(s) work(s).** In all likelihood, this will require parallel computing.

Depending on your problem selection, interests, and career goals, you should be able to do one of the following with a _highly successful project_:
  * use it as part of a portfolio to demonstrate to recruiters that you have unique, in-demand performance engineering skills
  * use it to demonstrate research skills in an application to graduate studies (in a related area)
  * refine it towards a publication venue (you'll already have the experiment results in place)


## Description

In groups, you will produce a report that compares a (naive) baseline solution, an optimised single-core solution, a multi-core solution, and a GPU solution to a selected problem. Your parallel solutions will substantially outperform the baseline. Some suggested problems, with difficulty ratings, are provided in a separate document; I will help you define meaningful test data. The report is "living"; i.e., you will be required to submit interim progress reports, but you can revisit them in subsequent submissions.

For students in CSC 485C, you should form groups of up to 3 students. Students in CSC 586C should find a partner; the partner can be registered in CSC 485C. Small groups (i.e., solo students or pairs of 485C students) are permitted and receive a boost in the _Difficulty_ criterion on the evaluation rubric, but may find the higher-weighted evaluation criteria (e.g., _Performance_ and _Analysis_) to be quite challenging. Evidence of group synergy will also be reflected in the final evaluation (_Contribution_ criterion); so, please try to choose your groupmates carefully.

There will be three interim submissions, one corresponding to each module of the course. These precede the corresponding midterm dates. They will be posted separately on conneX and have slight module-specific variations from the overall project. It is possible to improve marks on prior interim submissions up to half of the missing possible grades from the prior submission; e.g., if you receive 70% on the first interim report, you can improve those aspects in your second interim report to improve your first interim mark up to 85% (in addition to the independent grade that you receive on the second interim report). If you raise it to 75%, then you could further increase that to 80% on the third interim report. This reflects that you are still learning, even after the submission date, while incentivising you to balance your efforts throughout the semester.


## Submission

Each group should submit a report that describes:
  * their problem, e.g., by illustrative examples, formal mathematical definition, and/or reference to a source
  * the design decisions for solving it, e.g., algorithms, optimisations, and data structures/layout
  * by means of citation, any sources used
  * by means of plots and/or tables, experiment results from benchmarks and analysis, as shown in class
  * a discussion of the experiment results and how they relate to design decisions
  * an appendix in which the individual contribution of each group member is outlined (unnecessary for groups of only one student)

The report should aim for roughly ten double-column pages, excluding front matter and back matter (e.g., reference lists, non-critical appendices). Five pages is too few and twenty-one pages is too many. Length does not correlate strongly with grade.

Additionally, any resources needed to recreate the experiment results should be provided, e.g., by a time-sensitive link to a cloneable `git` repository (_Repeatability_ criterion).


## Evaluation

Submitted projects' will be evaluated according to the following rubric, which consists of five evaluation criteria:

**Performance** refers to the extent to which the course concepts have been _effectively_ applied to achieve a faster or more scalable solution. This correlates strongly with the notion of a _highly successful project_ above.

**Analysis** refers to the extent to which performance gains are _deliberate_ and _explicable_, e.g., by correctly diagnosing performance bottlenecks, selecting appropriate mitigating measures, and evaluating the extent to which those measures are responsible for the performance gains.

**Difficulty** is a static component that rewards more ambitious projects and compensates smaller groups.

**Contribution** represents the extent to which an individual in a group has made a proportionate effort.

**Repeatability** refers to the extent to and speed by which the claims and evidence presented in the final report can be independently verified.


Criterion|Weight|5|4|3|2|1
---------|------|-|-|-|-|-
Performance|25 %|GPU **and** multicore implementations shown to achieve >10x speed-up'' over optimised single-core baseline|GPU **or** multicore implementation shown to achieve >10x speed-up'' over optimised single-core baseline|Functional, correct implementations for both GPU **and** multicore that uses concepts from course|Functional, correct implementations for either GPU **or** multicore that uses concepts from course|No working parallel submission
Analysis|45 %|Performance directly shown to arise from improvements in hardware utilisation related to design decisions|Bottlenecks correctly demonstrated and direct correlation shown between performance and hardware utilisation|High-level architecture-conscious challenges identified and hardware utilisation metrics evaluated|Hardware utilisation studied, but relevance unclear|No architecture-conscious analysis 
Difficulty|10 %|Strong results likely to be publishable or monetisable **or** problem difficulty=4 but small group|Known, challenging problem with good, known architecture-conscious solutions **or** problem difficulty=3 but small group|Moderate problem for which obvious solutions exist; mostly a matter of re-implementing them|Embarrassingly parallel problem|N/A
Contribution|10 %|Clear group synergy and proportionate contribution relative to group size|Proportionate contribution relative to group size|Important contribution to group, though perhaps not proportionate|Contribution unclear|Might as well have spent the semester in Hawa'ii
Repeatability|10 %|TA can recreate (part of''') key plots in < 5 minutes|TA can recreate (part of''') key plots in < 15 minutes|TA can recreate key plots|TA can recreate some plots|Plots cannot be recreated from submitted materials and documentation


Students in CSC 586C will also be evaluated on a presentation of their project, the details of which will be released at a later date.
Groups can negotiate an alternative evaluation process if and only if:
  * it somehow facilitates more experiential learning (e.g., by relating closer to a thesis topic or career goal)
  * it is finalised at least four weeks prior to the deadline
  * the group consents to publishing their evaluation process and reason thereof on conneX for the sake of class-wide transparency


'Not submitting the project will result in a grade of _N_ for the course.

''Assuming a 16-core machine. Lower speed-up on a smaller machine may qualify if compelling evidence is given that the parallel scalability will continue to a 16-core machine.

'''Slow baselines and extreme x-axis values exempt. Does not include time to download datasets. Exact timings not expected, just general trends and performance spreads, i.e., the verification of the general claims in the report.
