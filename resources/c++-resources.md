# Resources to Boost your C++ Skills

Below are some resources that can help improve your C++ skills. The books are available as free online e-books through the UVic library. If you prefer hard copy, you can likely find used versions quite cheap. The other resources are available for free online.

In addition to these resources, you will learn a lot by coding, asking questions to resources like StackOverflow or the reference sites www.cplusplus.com and en.cppreference.com, and reviewing code samples such as those presented/developed in class.


## New to C++

_C++ Primer (5th Edition)_
Stanley B. Lippman, Jos√©e Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo (2013)

--------------------------------------

This is a standard introductory programming book for those looking for a guide to walk them through the basics. The features that make this stand out compared to other introductory c++ books are that it is available through the UVic library and that it starts from modern c++ and the STL, rather than basically teaching you C first. You'll be operational much faster.

Make sure to obtain the 5th edition. This is when they updated it with c++11 concepts. Earlier editions probably will not help you much.


## Understanding C++ Better

_Effective Modern C++_
Scott Meyers (2014)

---------------------------------------

This book (and the whole "Effective [] C++" series) has a unique Q&A format of providing a tip for better coding and then a rationale. Once you understand a modern c++ concept (e.g., `auto`), this book will help you understand _when_ to use it and _why_. It is good for developing programming skills in general, but assumes the reader already can compose programs in C++11. It is also available through the UVic library. I don't recommend it as a starting point, but it could be used in combination with another introductory book if you want to understand _why_ in addition to _what_ as you learn the language.


## Refining Your C++ Skills

_CPPCon Talks_ (Youtube)
Various authors

--------------------------------------

For continuous learning, I recommend the videos from the annual _CPPCon_ industry conference on C++, which are all posted to Youtube. It attracts high profile speakers and the level of topics is quite varied from introductory programming to advanced topics like multi-threading. While a passive form of learning, it is offers tremendous diversity and is self-driven as you can choose which topics to listen to. Most talks are about an hour.

It will take some curation though, as some talks are obviously better than others. You can use a proxy measure like the number of "likes", the reputation of the speaker, or recommendations from sites like reddit. Boccara's "105 STL Algorithms in Less Than an Hour" is a great example of how you can compress your exposure to a lot of C++ in a short amount of time, but you will probably need to have some experience in C++ first to really profit from the talk.
