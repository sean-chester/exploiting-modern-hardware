# How to contribute to this course design

It's always nice to have help! While this repository was designed for sharing more than for community contribution, pull requests and issues are certainly welcome. If you are considering contributing, first, thanks!!, and, second, please bear in mind the points below.

## For everyone

 * Please maintain a positive and inclusive tone. Refer to this [standard code of conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) if you are unsure what that entails.

## For students enrolled in the course

 * If you have questions, please use standard avenues to contact me (e.g., office hours, email), rather than opening an issue
 * If you notice a problem (e.g., bug, compile issue), please open an issue to ask about it before opening a pull request
 * If you find that something is missing, please be patient. You could ping me by email if it's important or urgent: I'm not put off by reminders.

## For others

 * Please recognise that I am prioritising students enrolled in my classes and so my response may be slow (on the order of 1-4 weeks)
 * If you have questions about understanding the material, feel free to open an issue, but I will likely just refer to you more reading resources
 * If you want to suggest improvements to the material or delivery, please open an issue. Learning is always done within a context, and this course has been adapted for Computer Science students at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/computerscience/index.php). I can advise as to whether the improvements are appropriate in this context
 * If you want to make substantial changes, it may be more appropriate to create your own fork, especially if it shifts the purpose or focus on this course
 * If you indicate your background (e.g., student, professional, professor) it can sometimes help me respond more precisely


## Guidelines

**For commits**, please follow the pattern of the repository:

  * construct relatively small commits
  * Use a short header message worded in the present tense
  * Provide a detailed second message as often as is appropriate. This should clarify the header
  * Consider prefacing the commit header with an emoji that communicates quickly the purpose of the commit; c.f., [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/)

**For source code**, please adopt the same style as the repository for the sake of consistency:

  * Braces on new lines
  * White space separating all tokens
  * [Spaces instead of tabs](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/) ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
  * *Extensive* documentation, even of basic concepts: remember that significant c++ experience is *not* a prerequisite for this course. _This is pedagogical material._
  * Generic (i.e., template) code as much as it makes sense
  * Use of modern (e.g., c++11 and beyond) language features, unless it interferes with demonstrating a specific concept

**For markdown**, please test the rendering with a markdown viewer such as [StackEdit](stackedit.io/)

**For LaTeX**, please:

  * Use a single latex file when possible to keep the repository cleaner
  * Split into multiple files and place into a subdirectory if you need to include attachments (e.g., `.jpg`, `.csv`) or if the file becomes unwieldy (e.g., >1000 lines)
  * Split into multiple files and place into a subdirectory if using a lot of tikz, with each tikz picture separated into its own file
